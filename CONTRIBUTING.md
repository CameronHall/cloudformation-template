# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/cloudformation-template.git
```

Test your changes to ensure the CloudFormation template can still create the required 
resources for the Datadog AWS integration.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/your-username/cloudformation-template/compare/DataDog:master...master

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
